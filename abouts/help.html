<h3>How do I know how much waste a site imported as an amount, rather than a percent?</h3>
<p class = "help"> Hovering over a site highlights the percent of waste that that particular site imported (on the right side panel).  Clicking on the site displays a panel on the left showing the total kilograms or liters imported by that site, as well as where that site ranks among other importers.  </p>
<h3>What if I want to look at state information, rather than site information?</h3>
<p class = "help">On the left hand side of the screen, select ‘states’.  This will display a choropleth map showing the amount each state imported during the selected time period.  Hovering over a particular state will display the number of sites located in that state, as well as the amount of the selected waste (solid or liquid) imported by that state. </p>
<h3> How do I find out how a particular site is disposing of the waste? </h3>
<p class = "help">Select ‘disposal’ on the right hand side.  Hover over the bar chart to get a feel for the different ways sites dispose of waste. Selecting one of the disposal types will highlight the sites that dispose of waste in that way.  Additionally, the panel at the right will give more detail about what that disposal method is. 
<h3>How do I find out what types of waste a particular site imported?</h3>
<p class = "help">Selecting a site displays a panel on the left that gives information about a given site, including the types of waste that site imported.  To find out more about a particular waste type, select ‘type’ on the right side panel, then select the desired waste type from the bar chart.  Information about that waste type will be displayed below.</p>
<h3>Can I also look at demographic information along with the waste information?</h3>
<p class = "help">Yes.  Poverty and race data can be overlaid on the map by selecting ‘poverty’ or ‘race’ from the right side panel.  For site specific information, first select or search for the site of interest.  From the left side panel that opens, select the ‘demographics’ tab to obtain more detailed race and poverty information for that site. </p>   
<h3>Why is there liquid and solid waste?</h3>
<p class = "help">We maintain the separation between solid and liquid waste in HazMatMapper given ambiguity in conversions between different hazardous elements. While this distinction is useful for analysis of the dataset, it does not reflect the regulatory definition of hazardous waste, which hinges on different notions of “solid” (40 USC. Sec 261.2. 2012).</p>
<h3>Why are there liquid wastes under the solid category and vice versa?</h3>
<p class = "help"> Because people report things in volume vs. weight.</p>
<h3>What does N.O.S. mean?</h3>
<p class = "help"> The waste is not otherwise specified, so specific hazards are unknown</p>
